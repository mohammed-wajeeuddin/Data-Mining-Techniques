 Designed and implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras within a Google Colab notebook environment.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `FINAL_PROJECT_DATA_MINING_.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Loaded and visualized real-world weather dataset
- ✅ Normalized and reshaped data for LSTM input
- ✅ Built and trained an LSTM model for time-series forecasting
- ✅ Evaluated model performance using RMSE and loss curves
- ✅ Visualized predicted vs actual values

## 📊 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 📈 Model Architecture

- LSTM layer (50 units)
- Dense output layer
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Adam optimizer

## 🔍 Results

The model was able to capture temporal trends and produced a relatively low RMSE, indicating promising predictive capabilities on weather time-series data.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Upload your own `.csv` dataset or use the default data path.
4. Analyze the plots and performance metrics for insights.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning (batch size, learning rate)
- Try other models like GRU or Transformer
- Integrate real-time data pipelines
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
